'''
Primary user-adjustable control parameters:

We encourage you to freely tune these values as needed to match the
 behavior and performance of your AxiDraw to your application and taste.

These parameters are used as defaults when using AxiDraw with the command-
 line interface (CLI) or with the python API. With the CLI, you can make
 copies of this configuration file and specify one as a configuration file.
 When using the Python API, override individual settings within your script.

 If you are operating the AxiDraw from within Inkscape, please set your
  preferences within Inkscape, using the AxiDraw Control dialog. Settings
  that appear both here and in AxiDraw Control will be ignored; those
  from AxiDraw Control will be used. Other settings can be configured here.

Settings within Inkscape only affect use within Inkscape, and do not affect
 the behavior of the AxiDraw CLI or Python APIs.
