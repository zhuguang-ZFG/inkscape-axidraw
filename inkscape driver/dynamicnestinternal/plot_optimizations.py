plot_optimizations.py

Version 1.2.0   -   2022-10-25

This module provides some plot optimization tools.

Part of the AxiDraw driver for Inkscape
https://github.com/evil-mad/AxiDraw

Requires Python 3.7 or newer.


The included functions operate upon a "flat" DocDigest object.

The "flattened" requirement means that each PathItem in each layer of
the DocDigest contains only a single subpath.


These functions include:
(A) connect_nearby_ends()
    - Search for and join nearby path ends in the layer, within given tolerance
    - If path reversal is enabled, allow paths to be reversed for joining

(B) randomize_start()
    - Randomize start location for closed paths

(C) reorder()
    - Perform nearest neighbor plot reordering, if enabled
    - If path reversal is enabled, allow paths to be reversed when sorting

    When drawing (say) a set of otherwise identical concentric circles with a
    pen, there will be an artifact generated from where the pen touches down

    However, if all the start locations line up in a perfect row, the tiny artifacts

    You can reduce the visibility of this artifact by randomizing the start
